# Life-Expectancy-of-People
The dataset comes from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries. The data-sets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries have been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. It has been observed that in the past 15 years, there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this case study we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis. The individual data files have been merged together into a single data-set.

# Steps
Understand the variables in the data set, study about the Industry and perceive the business objective

Created hypothesis and validated

Identifing the statistical model to use (compare pros / cons of different models before accepting a model to follow) based on the kind of variables

Clean the data set. That is, imputing missing values with the necessary values, detection of outliers and treatment of extreme outliers in the variables with the required method

Using Principal Component analysis

Run Regression model

Check which variables are significant by looking at p values, conclude them accordingly. Observe variable relationships of predictor variables and target variables

Does different tests like multicollinearity test, Homoscedasticity test, Normality test, serial correlation, MAPE (mean and median error percentage) and model accuracy.

Mentioned goodness of fit statistics (R-square, adjusted R-squares).
